# Instagram Data Collection and Vectorization Project

## Project Overview

This project aims to collect, process, and store data from Instagram posts in a vector database. The system will fetch data for the last 100 posts, including comments and engagement metrics, and update this information hourly. The processed data will be used to power an AI-driven commenting system.

## Tech Stack

- Google Cloud Functions (Python)
- Instagram Graph API
- Pinecone Vector Database
- OpenAI API (for generating embeddings)

## Programming Goals for Google Cloud Function

### 1. Instagram Data Fetching

- Implement authentication with Instagram Graph API
- Fetch last 100 posts with metadata
- Retrieve comments for each post
- Handle pagination for both posts and comments
- Implement rate limiting to respect API constraints

### 2. Data Processing

- Parse raw API responses
- Calculate engagement metrics (likes, comment count, etc.)
- Prepare data structure for vectorization
- Generate embeddings using OpenAI API

### 3. Pinecone Integration

- Initialize Pinecone client
- Prepare data for Pinecone upsert operation
- Implement upsert logic with metadata strategy
- Ensure data can be filtered by metadata or searched globally

### 4. Update Mechanism

- Implement timestamp-based update system
- Fetch only new or updated data since last run
- Prevent duplicate entries in Pinecone

### 5. Error Handling and Logging

- Implement comprehensive error handling
- Set up detailed logging for troubleshooting
- Create alerting system for critical failures

### 6. Testing

- Write unit tests for critical functions
- Implement integration tests for API interactions
- Create end-to-end tests for the entire data flow

### 7. Scheduling and Deployment

- Set up Cloud Scheduler for hourly runs
- Configure appropriate IAM roles and permissions
- Deploy function to Google Cloud

## Additional Considerations

- Ensure compliance with Instagram's terms of service
- Optimize for cost and performance
- Implement secure handling of API keys and tokens
- Document the system thoroughly for future maintenance

By following these guidelines, you and your AI copilot can create a robust Google Cloud Function that efficiently collects Instagram data, processes it, and stores it in Pinecone for further use in your AI commenting system.
